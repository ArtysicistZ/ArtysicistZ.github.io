# Implementation Plan - Personal Website

## Goal
Create a modern, premium personal website for Yincheng Zhou, a UPenn VIPER student (CIS & Physics). The website will serve as a portfolio for SWE internship recruiting.
The site will be strictly **static (HTML/CSS/JS)** with **no build steps (no npm, no node_modules)**, making it instantly deployable to GitHub Pages and runnable locally by simply opening `index.html`.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Build Build Step**: As requested, the site will use vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This means no React/Vue/Next.js. This simplifies deployment but means we write raw DOM manipulation for interactivity.
> **Deployment**: You will need to push these files to a GitHub repository named `yourusername.github.io` to go live.

## Proposed Changes

### Structure
I will create a standard static site directory structure in a new folder (e.g., `D:\Code\Personal Website`).

#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///D:/Code/Personal%20Website/index.html)
The single-page site structure containing:
1.  **Hero Section**:
    *   Greeting ("Hi, I'm Yincheng Zhou")
    *   Tagline (UPenn VIPER | CIS & Physics | Full Stack & AI)
    *   CTA Buttons ("View Projects", "Resume")
2.  **About Section**:
    *   Bio based on Resume (Dual degree, interests).
3.  **Experience Section**:
    *   Franklink, Inc. (Founding Software Engineer)
    *   Kaixin Technology (Intern)
4.  **Projects Section**:
    *   **Franklink-iMessage**: Networking assistant, LangGraph, ECS.
    *   **ADK NL2SQL**: SQL-first RAG robot.
    *   **AlphaOne**: Fintech dashboard (React/FastAPI).
5.  **Skills Section**:
    *   Categorized list (Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Cloud).
6.  **Contact/Footer**:
    *   Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, Email.

#### [NEW] [style.css](file:///D:/Code/Personal%20Website/style.css)
*   **Theme**: Modern Dark Mode (Deep Navy/Black background with vibrant accents like Electric Blue or Neon Purple).
*   **Typography**: Inter or System UI fonts for clean look.
*   **Responsiveness**: Flexbox/Grid layouts to work on mobile and desktop.
*   **Animations**:
    *   Fade-in on scroll.
    *   Hover effects on project cards (glassmorphism).
    *   Smooth scrolling navigation.

#### [NEW] [script.js](file:///D:/Code/Personal%20Website/script.js)
*   Smooth scrolling behavior for nav links.
*   "Typewriter" effect for the hero tagline.
*   Intersection Observer for scroll animations (elements fading in as you scroll down).

#### [NEW] [assets/](file:///D:/Code/Personal%20Website/assets/)
*   Folder for images. I will generate placeholder images or use CSS shapes initially.

### Tech Stack Details
*   **HTML5**: Semantic tags (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`).
*   **CSS3**: Variables for colors, Flexbox/Grid, Media Queries.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
*   Since this is a static site without a test runner, I will rely on browser verification.

### Manual Verification
1.  **Local Run**: Open `index.html` directly in the browser.
2.  **Visual Check**:
    *   Verify Hero section has typing effect.
    *   Verify Navigation links scroll to correct sections.
    *   Verify Project cards display correct info from resume.
    *   Verify Mobile view (resize window) routes stacking correctly.
3.  **Content Accuracy**: Check against `D:\Desktop\Penn\Resume\v1.0_1.31.26.tex`.
